*                                                     *
* Instructions:                                       *
*  To roll, type the number of dice, then the number  *
*  of sides then any modifiers, all separated by      *
*  spaces.                                            *
*                                                     *
*  like this:  3 6 -1                                 *
*  that would mean:                                   *
*   Roll 3 6-sided dice, and subtract 1 from each die *
*                                                     *
*  To exit, enter: 1 1 1                              *
*  ENJOY!                                             *
